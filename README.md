# python-challenge
This is the third of the challenge done by stephen Fernandes
I did get a lot of help from the ASKBSC, and I left comments on where they did help 
there were two issues I could not get the dates to work, and when I put the output for the .txt it all on the row 
As well, I left a comment on the issue that did occur with retrieving the files that were on my system (I put the actual code in the comments)
I should add more commits next time with adding the files and editing through commit function
