# python-challenge
This is the thrid of the challange done by stephen Fernandes
I did get a lot of help from the ASKBSC and I left comments on where they did help 
there was two issues I could not get the dates to work and when I put the output for the .txt its all on the row 
As well, I left a comment on the issue that did occur with retriving the files that was on my system (I put the acutal code in comments)
